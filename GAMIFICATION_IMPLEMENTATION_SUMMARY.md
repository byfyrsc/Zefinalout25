## Key Features Implemented

### Gamification Dashboard
- Customer profile display (points, level, badges)
- Achievement tracking with progress bars
- Badge showcase with rarity indicators
- Statistics overview (feedback count, average rating, etc.)
- Leaderboard integration

### Events Hub
- List of available events
- Event participation functionality
- Event details (type, status, requirements)
- Progress tracking for ongoing events

### Rewards Hub
- Reward catalog with point costs
- Reward redemption functionality
- Redemption history tracking
- Points balance display

### Mobile-First Design
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Bottom navigation for mobile devices
- Adaptive components for different viewports

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- React hooks for local component state
- Custom hook for gamification data management
- Service layer for data operations
- Mock data for development and testing

### Data Flow
1. Customer navigates to gamification section
2. Custom hook fetches data from service layer
3. Service layer retrieves data from database (or mock data)
4. Components render data and provide interaction points
5. User actions trigger service layer operations
6. Database is updated and UI reflects changes

### Security Considerations
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- Authentication required for all gamification features
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Proper error handling to avoid information leakage

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
1. `gamification_profiles` - Customer profiles with points, badges, achievements
2. `rewards` - Catalog of available rewards
3. `reward_redemptions` - History of reward redemptions
4. `gamification_points` - History of point transactions

### New Functions
1. `redeem_customer_reward` - Redeems rewards for customers
2. `award_customer_points` - Awards points to customers

### Indexes
- Indexes on foreign keys for performance
- Indexes on frequently queried columns

## Integration Points

### With Existing Feedback System
- Points awarded for feedback submission
- Achievements unlocked based on feedback metrics
- Events tied to feedback campaigns

### With Authentication System
- Gamification data tied to authenticated users
- Tenant isolation through RLS policies
- Profile data integrated with user accounts

### With Analytics System
- Gamification metrics tracked in analytics
- Leaderboard data available for reporting
- Event performance monitoring

## Future Enhancements

### Social Features
- Friend systems
- Social challenges
- Sharing achievements

### Advanced Analytics
- Detailed gamification metrics dashboard
- Predictive modeling for customer engagement
- A/B testing for gamification features

### Mobile App Integration
