   - Validates service functions and data structures

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Performance Improvements

- **New Indexes**: Added GIN indexes on JSON columns and composite indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Materialized Views**: Created `daily_feedback_summary` for faster analytics queries
- **Query Optimization**: Enhanced table structures for better query performance

### 2. Analytics Capabilities

- **Enhanced Analytics Functions**: Added RPC functions for tenant usage statistics and analytics summaries
- **Normalized Feedback Data**: Separated feedback questions and responses for better analysis
- **Dashboard Component**: Created a comprehensive analytics dashboard with charts and metrics

### 3. User Engagement

- **Notification System**: Implemented a complete notification system with CRUD operations
- **Notifications Panel**: Created a UI component for managing notifications
- **User Activity Tracking**: Added last activity tracking to user records

### 4. Data Model Improvements

- **Enhanced Audit Trail**: Created `audit_logs_enhanced` with more detailed tracking
- **Segmentation Criteria**: Improved customer segmentation with detailed criteria
- **Feedback Normalization**: Normalized feedback questions and responses for better analytics

### 5. Maintenance and Automation

- **Automated Functions**: Created functions for refreshing materialized views and cleaning up old data
- **Trigger-Based Updates**: Implemented triggers for automatic data updates
- **Campaign Metrics**: Added functions for updating campaign metrics based on engagement data

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Queries are now faster with the new indexes and materialized views
2. **Better Analytics**: Enhanced analytics capabilities with normalized data and pre-calculated metrics
3. **User Engagement**: Notification system keeps users informed about important events
4. **Scalability**: Design supports horizontal scaling and large data volumes
5. **Maintainability**: Well-organized schema with clear relationships between entities
6. **Security**: Proper RLS policies ensure data isolation between tenants

## Implementation Status
