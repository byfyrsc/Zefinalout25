# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the InteliFeed Hub application to protect user data and ensure secure operation.

## Authentication Security

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum 5 authentication attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Account lockout after repeated failed attempts
- Session expiration after 24 hours of inactivity

### Session Management
- Automatic session extension prompts
- Secure token storage
- Session cleanup on logout

## Input Validation

### Client-Side Sanitization
- XSS prevention through HTML entity encoding
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Email format validation

### Server-Side Validation
- Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Database constraint enforcement
- API request validation

## Rate Limiting

### API Endpoints
- General requests: 100 requests per minute
- Authentication endpoints: 20 requests per minute
- Feedback submission: 50 requests per minute

### Implementation
Rate limiting is implemented using an in-memory store in the application. In production, this should be replaced with a distributed cache like Redis for multi-instance deployments.

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Passwords: bcrypt hashing with salt
- Data in transit: HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Sensitive data at rest: Database encryption

### Privacy
- GDPR compliance
- Data minimization
- User data portability

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Events
- Failed login attempts
- Password changes
- Profile updates
- Rate limit exceeded events

### Audit Trail
- All security events are logged to the `audit_logs` table
- Logs include timestamp, IP address, user agent, and event details

## Best Practices

### Development
- Never log sensitive information
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Deployment
- HTTPS only
- Security headers
- Content Security Policy
- Regular backups

## Future Enhancements

### Multi-Factor Authentication
Planned for future implementation to add an additional layer of security.

### IP Whitelisting
For enterprise accounts, IP whitelisting will be available to restrict access to specific IP ranges.

### Advanced Threat Detection
Machine learning-based anomaly detection for suspicious activities.
