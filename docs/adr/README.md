# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document the architectural decisions made during the development of the InteliFeed Hub platform. Each ADR follows a standardized format to ensure consistency and clarity.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide a historical record for future reference.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: A brief, descriptive title
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, or Deprecated
3. **Context**: The circumstances that led to the decision
4. **Decision**: What was decided
5. **Consequences**: The results of the decision (positive and negative)

## ADR List

1. [ADR-001: Multi-tenant Architecture](adr-001-multi-tenant-architecture.md) - Decision to implement a multi-tenant architecture
2. [ADR-002: Supabase as Backend](adr-002-supabase-backend.md) - Decision to use Supabase as the backend platform

6. [ADR-006: Authentication Strategy](adr-006-authentication-strategy.md) - Decision on authentication implementation
7. [ADR-007: Database Schema Design](adr-007-database-schema.md) - Decision on database schema structure
8. [ADR-008: Mobile-First Approach](adr-008-mobile-first.md) - Decision to adopt a mobile-first design approach
9. [ADR-009: PWA Implementation](adr-009-pwa-implementation.md) - Decision to implement Progressive Web App features

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions, create a new ADR using the following process:

1. Copy the ADR template
2. Assign the next sequential number
3. Fill in the ADR details
4. Get team review and approval
5. Update the status to "Accepted"
6. Add the ADR to the list above

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated]

## Context

[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision

[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences

[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]
