# ADR-010: Accessibility Standards

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the InteliFeed Hub platform, we needed to determine the appropriate level of accessibility compliance to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities while balancing development effort and business requirements.

Key considerations included:
- Legal compliance requirements (ADA, Section 508, etc.)
- Ethical responsibility to serve all users
- Market expansion to include users with disabilities
- Development effort and cost implications
- Testing and validation requirements
- Ongoing maintenance and updates
- Competitive advantage through inclusive design

We evaluated several accessibility standards:
1. **WCAG 2.0 Level A**: Minimum accessibility requirements
2. **WCAG 2.0 Level AA**: Standard accessibility requirements (most common)
3. **WCAG 2.0 Level AAA**: Highest accessibility requirements
4. **WCAG 2.1**: Updated standards with mobile considerations
5. **Custom Accessibility Implementation**: Selective accessibility features

## Decision

We chose to implement **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance as our accessibility standard for the following reasons:
- Meets legal requirements in most jurisdictions
- Balances user needs with development effort
- Industry standard for most commercial applications
- Includes mobile-specific considerations
- Provides good return on investment
- Aligns with our company values of inclusivity
