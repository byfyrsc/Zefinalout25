# ADR-005: State Management Solution

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the InteliFeed Hub platform, we needed to determine the best approach for managing application state across components. The platform requires handling various types of state including user authentication, tenant context, UI state, server data, and real-time updates.

Key considerations included:
- Complexity of state management needs
- Performance characteristics
- Developer experience and learning curve
- Integration with React and TypeScript
- Bundle size impact
- Real-time data handling
- Server state vs. client state separation

We evaluated several options:
1. **React Context**: Built-in React solution for state sharing
2. **Redux**: Mature state management library with extensive ecosystem
3. **Zustand**: Small, fast state management solution
4. **Recoil**: Facebook's experimental state management library
5. **React Query**: Server state management solution
6. **Jotai**: Primitive and flexible state management

## Decision

We decided to use a **hybrid approach** with the following technologies:
- **Zustand** for client-side global state management
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Context** for simple state sharing and dependency injection

This approach separates concerns between client state (UI preferences, user settings) and server state (data from APIs, real-time updates).

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between client and server state
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with Zustand's minimal overhead
- **Developer Experience**: Simple API with excellent TypeScript support
- **Real-time Capabilities**: React Query's integration with Supabase real-time features
- **Bundle Size**: Minimal impact on bundle size compared to Redux
- **Flexibility**: Ability to choose the right tool for each state management need
- **Learning Curve**: Gentle learning curve for development team

### Negative Consequences
- **Multiple Libraries**: Increased complexity from using multiple state management solutions
- **Consistency**: Potential inconsistency in state management patterns
- **Debugging**: More challenging debugging across multiple state sources
- **Documentation**: Need to maintain documentation for multiple approaches
- **Team Coordination**: Requires clear guidelines for when to use each solution

### Neutral Consequences
- **Migration Path**: Straightforward migration from one solution to another if needed
- **Community Support**: All chosen solutions have active communities
- **Feature Parity**: Each solution excels in its specific domain
- **Maintenance**: Multiple libraries to keep updated
