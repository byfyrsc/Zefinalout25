# ADR-008: Mobile-First Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the InteliFeed Hub platform, we needed to determine the best approach for designing and developing the user interface to serve our primary target audience: restaurant staff and managers who would primarily access the platform on mobile devices.

Key considerations included:
- Primary user device preferences (mobile vs. desktop)
- User experience requirements for field staff
- Performance constraints on mobile networks
- Touch interface optimization
- Offline capabilities for unreliable connectivity
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Development and maintenance efficiency

We evaluated several approaches:
1. **Desktop-First**: Design for desktop screens first, then adapt to mobile
2. **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile screens first, then enhance for desktop
3. **Responsive**: Single codebase that adapts to all screen sizes
4. **Separate Mobile App**: Native mobile application in addition to web app

## Decision

We chose a **Mobile-First Responsive Design** approach for the following reasons:
- Restaurant staff primarily use mobile devices for quick access
- Mobile-first ensures optimal performance on constrained networks
- Single codebase reduces development and maintenance costs
- Progressive enhancement provides richer experience on larger screens
- Touch-friendly interface improves usability for all users
- Offline-first capabilities support field staff needs
- Cross-platform compatibility through web technologies

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **User Experience**: Optimized experience for primary user base
- **Performance**: Fast loading and interaction on mobile networks
- **Development Efficiency**: Single codebase for all platforms
- **Maintenance**: Simplified updates and bug fixes
- **Accessibility**: Touch-friendly interface benefits all users
- **Future-Proofing**: Adapts to evolving device landscape
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for separate native app development

### Negative Consequences
- **Desktop Experience**: May not fully leverage desktop capabilities
- **Complexity**: Need to balance mobile and desktop requirements
- **Testing**: Requires testing across multiple device types and sizes
- **Performance Trade-offs**: May need to defer some desktop features
- **Input Method Differences**: Need to handle touch vs. keyboard/mouse interactions

### Neutral Consequences
- **Browser Support**: Need to support mobile browsers adequately
- **Feature Parity**: May not achieve 100% feature parity across devices
- **Design Constraints**: Mobile-first may limit some desktop design possibilities
- **User Adoption**: Some desktop users may need adjustment period
