# ADR-001: Multi-tenant Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The InteliFeed Hub platform is designed as a SaaS solution for restaurant feedback management. We needed to determine the best architectural approach to serve multiple restaurant groups (tenants) while maintaining data isolation, ensuring security, and enabling efficient resource utilization.

Key considerations included:
- Data isolation between tenants
- Resource efficiency and cost management
- Scalability for growing tenant base
- Simplified deployment and maintenance
- Compliance with data privacy regulations

We evaluated three main approaches:
1. **Single-tenant architecture**: Separate instances for each tenant
2. **Multi-tenant shared database**: Shared database with separate schemas
3. **Multi-tenant shared schema**: Shared database and schema with row-level security

## Decision

We decided to implement a **multi-tenant shared schema** architecture using PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation. This approach uses a single database instance with a shared schema where each table includes a `tenant_id` column, and RLS policies ensure that tenants can only access their own data.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal use of database resources with shared infrastructure
- **Simplified Operations**: Single database instance to manage, backup, and monitor
- **Cost Effective**: Lower operational costs compared to single-tenant approach
- **Easier Scaling**: Simpler horizontal scaling of the database layer
- **Consistent Performance**: Uniform performance characteristics across tenants
- **Streamlined Updates**: Database schema updates applied uniformly to all tenants

### Negative Consequences
- **Security Complexity**: Increased complexity in implementing and maintaining RLS policies
- **Cross-tenant Risks**: Potential for data leakage if RLS policies are misconfigured
- **Performance Interference**: Risk of "noisy neighbor" problems affecting other tenants
- **Limited Customization**: Difficult to implement tenant-specific schema customizations
- **Compliance Challenges**: May require additional measures for strict data residency requirements

### Neutral Consequences
- **Development Overhead**: Additional development effort to implement tenant context in all queries
- **Testing Complexity**: Need for comprehensive multi-tenant testing scenarios
- **Monitoring Requirements**: Enhanced monitoring to detect cross-tenant data access
