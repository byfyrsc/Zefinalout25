# ADR-006: Authentication Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the InteliFeed Hub platform, we needed to implement a secure and user-friendly authentication system that would support multiple tenant organizations, various user roles, and modern authentication best practices.

Key requirements included:
- Secure user authentication with password policies
- Role-based access control for multi-tenant environment
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Password reset and account recovery
- Session management with proper timeouts
- Compliance with security standards (OWASP, etc.)
- Integration with Supabase Auth
- Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA)

We evaluated several approaches:
1. **Custom Authentication**: Build authentication from scratch
2. **Supabase Auth**: Use Supabase's built-in authentication
3. **Auth0**: Third-party authentication service
4. **Firebase Auth**: Google's authentication service
5. **OAuth2/OpenID Connect**: Standard-based authentication protocols

## Decision

We chose to use **Supabase Auth** with a custom wrapper for the following reasons:
- Native integration with our Supabase backend
- Built-in support for email/password, social logins, and magic links
- Automatic JWT token management
- Row Level Security integration with PostgreSQL
- Cost-effective compared to third-party services
- Open-source and self-hostable
- Strong security features including MFA support
- Excellent TypeScript support

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Security**: Built-in security features and best practices
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Supabase database and RLS
- **Cost**: No additional costs for authentication service
- **Maintenance**: Reduced maintenance overhead
- **Flexibility**: Custom wrapper allows for specific business logic
- **Scalability**: Handles authentication at scale
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows OAuth2 and OpenID Connect standards

### Negative Consequences
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tied to Supabase authentication implementation
- **Customization Limits**: Limited customization compared to custom solution
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Supabase Auth specifics
- **Migration Complexity**: Potential challenges if migrating to different auth system
- **Feature Dependencies**: Dependent on Supabase for new auth features

### Neutral Consequences
- **Support**: Reliance on Supabase community and documentation
- **Updates**: Need to keep up with Supabase Auth updates
- **Compliance**: May require additional measures for specific compliance needs
- **Extensibility**: Some advanced features may require custom implementation
