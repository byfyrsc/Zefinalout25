# ADR-009: PWA Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the InteliFeed Hub platform, we needed to decide whether to implement Progressive Web App (PWA) features to enhance the user experience, particularly for mobile users who may have unreliable network connectivity or want to install the app on their devices.

Key considerations included:
- Offline capabilities for field staff with poor connectivity
- App-like experience on mobile devices
- Installation on home screen for quick access
- Push notifications for important updates
- Performance improvements through caching
- Development and maintenance overhead
- Browser compatibility and support

We evaluated several approaches:
1. **No PWA Features**: Traditional web application only
2. **Basic PWA**: Manifest file and offline caching only
3. **Full PWA**: Complete PWA implementation with service workers, push notifications, and offline capabilities
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Selective PWA features based on user needs

## Decision

We chose to implement a **Full PWA** with the following features:
- Web App Manifest for home screen installation
- Service workers for offline caching and background sync
- Push notifications for real-time updates
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- App-like navigation and user experience
- Performance optimizations through caching strategies

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Offline Access**: Users can access core features without network connectivity
- **Improved Performance**: Caching strategies reduce load times
- **User Engagement**: Push notifications increase user retention
- **App-like Experience**: Installation and usage similar to native apps
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on all modern browsers and devices
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for separate native app development
- **SEO Benefits**: Better search engine indexing compared to native apps

### Negative Consequences
- **Development Complexity**: Additional complexity in implementation and testing
- **Browser Limitations**: Not all browsers support all PWA features
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Service workers and caching require ongoing maintenance
- **Storage Usage**: Caching may use significant device storage
- **Debugging Challenges**: PWA features can be difficult to debug
- **Feature Gaps**: Some native app features may not be available

### Neutral Consequences
- **User Education**: Users may need education on PWA capabilities
- **Platform Differences**: Behavior may vary across different platforms
- **Update Management**: Service worker updates require careful management
- **Security Considerations**: HTTPS requirement for all PWA features
