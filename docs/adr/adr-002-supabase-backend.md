# ADR-002: Supabase as Backend

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the InteliFeed Hub platform, we needed to select a backend solution that would provide database services, authentication, real-time capabilities, and storage while minimizing development overhead and operational complexity. 

Our requirements included:
- PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
- Built-in authentication and authorization
- File storage with CDN integration
- Serverless functions for custom logic
- Good TypeScript integration
- Cost-effective pricing model
- Managed service to reduce operational burden

We evaluated several options:
1. **Custom backend with Express/Node.js**: Full control but high development and maintenance overhead
2. **Firebase**: Comprehensive backend-as-a-service but vendor lock-in concerns
3. **AWS Amplify**: AWS ecosystem integration but complexity for non-AWS deployments
4. **Supabase**: Open-source Firebase alternative with PostgreSQL backend

## Decision

We chose **Supabase** as our backend platform for the following reasons:
- Open-source and self-hostable, avoiding vendor lock-in
- PostgreSQL database with all its advanced features
- Built-in authentication with social login providers
- Real-time subscriptions using WebSockets
- Storage system with automatic CDN integration
- Edge functions for serverless compute
- Excellent TypeScript support with auto-generated types
- Competitive pricing model
- Active community and regular updates

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Rapid Development**: Pre-built backend services accelerate development
- **Real-time Features**: Built-in real-time capabilities for live updates
- **Reduced Operational Overhead**: Managed service reduces DevOps burden
- **Open Source Flexibility**: Ability to self-host if needed
- **PostgreSQL Ecosystem**: Access to rich PostgreSQL features and extensions
- **Strong TypeScript Integration**: Auto-generated types improve developer experience
- **Cost Predictability**: Transparent pricing model

### Negative Consequences
- **Vendor Dependency**: Tied to Supabase platform and its evolution
- **Limited Customization**: Less flexibility than custom backend solutions
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Supabase-specific concepts
- **Service Limitations**: Bound by Supabase service capabilities and limitations
- **Migration Complexity**: Potential challenges if migrating away from Supabase

### Neutral Consequences
- **Community Maturity**: Supabase is relatively new compared to established solutions
- **Feature Parity**: May lack some advanced features of mature platforms
- **Support Options**: Reliance on community support and documentation
- **Performance Characteristics**: Performance depends on Supabase infrastructure
