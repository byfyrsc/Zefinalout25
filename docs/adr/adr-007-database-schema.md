# ADR-007: Database Schema Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the InteliFeed Hub platform, we needed to design a database schema that would efficiently support our multi-tenant SaaS application for restaurant feedback management. The schema needed to handle various entities including tenants, users, locations, feedback, campaigns, and analytics while ensuring data integrity, performance, and scalability.

Key considerations included:
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Efficient querying for analytics and reporting
- Support for real-time updates
- Normalization vs. denormalization trade-offs
- Indexing strategy for performance
- Extensibility for future features
- Compliance with data privacy regulations

We evaluated several schema design approaches:
1. **Highly Normalized**: Maximum normalization with separate tables for all entities
2. **Denormalized for Performance**: Denormalized schema for read-heavy operations
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Balanced normalization with strategic denormalization
4. **JSON-based Storage**: Flexible schema using JSON columns for variable data

## Decision

We chose a **hybrid approach** with the following characteristics:
- Normalized core entities (tenants, users, locations, feedback)
- Strategic denormalization for frequently accessed data
- JSON columns for flexible, variable data structures
- Comprehensive indexing strategy
- Materialized views for analytics performance
- Row Level Security for multi-tenant isolation
- Proper foreign key constraints for data integrity

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Data Integrity**: Strong consistency through foreign key constraints
- **Query Performance**: Optimized indexing and materialized views
- **Flexibility**: JSON columns for variable data structures
- **Analytics Performance**: Materialized views for fast reporting
- **Security**: Built-in RLS for tenant data isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear entity relationships and documentation
- **Extensibility**: Room for future feature additions

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: More complex schema than fully denormalized approach
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Need to maintain indexes and materialized views
- **Migration Complexity**: Schema changes may require careful migration planning
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand the hybrid approach
- **Query Complexity**: Some queries may require joins across multiple tables

### Neutral Consequences
- **Storage Requirements**: Balanced storage needs between normalized and denormalized approaches
- **Write Performance**: Some write overhead due to normalization
- **Schema Evolution**: Requires careful planning for schema changes
- **Backup and Recovery**: Standard backup and recovery procedures apply
