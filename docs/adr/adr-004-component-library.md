# ADR-004: Component Library Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the InteliFeed Hub platform, we needed to select a UI component library that would provide a consistent, accessible, and customizable design system while integrating well with our React and TypeScript stack. 

Key requirements included:
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA or higher)
- Responsive design capabilities
- Customization and theming support
- TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- Active maintenance and community support
- Performance considerations
- Design consistency across the application

We evaluated several options:
1. **Material-UI (MUI)**: Popular React component library with Material Design
2. **Ant Design**: Comprehensive enterprise-focused component library
3. **Chakra UI**: Simple, modular, and accessible component library
4. **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
5. **Shadcn UI**: Reusable component library built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS

## Decision

We chose **Shadcn UI** built on top of **Radix UI** and **Tailwind CSS** for the following reasons:
- Excellent accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Unstyled components allowing complete design customization
- First-class TypeScript support with strict typing
- Copy-paste approach allowing selective component adoption
- Integration with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Lightweight with minimal runtime overhead
- Active development and community support
- Alignment with modern design trends

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility compliance
- **Customization**: Complete control over component appearance
- **Performance**: Minimal runtime overhead
- **Maintainability**: Copy-paste approach reduces dependency complexity
- **Design Consistency**: Tailwind CSS integration ensures consistent styling
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and documentation
- **Flexibility**: Ability to modify components as needed

### Negative Consequences
- **Initial Setup**: Requires configuration of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Migration Effort**: Manual work to adapt components to our design system
- **Update Management**: Manual updates when Radix UI releases new versions
- **Limited Components**: Smaller component library compared to comprehensive solutions

### Neutral Consequences
- **Community Size**: Smaller community compared to established libraries
- **Third-party Integrations**: Fewer pre-built integrations with other libraries
- **Design Opinions**: Less prescriptive design guidance compared to opinionated libraries
- **Component Maturity**: Some components may be less mature than established libraries
