# InteliFeed Hub - Architecture Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the InteliFeed Hub platform architecture, summarizing the key components, patterns, and decisions that define the system.

## System Overview

InteliFeed Hub is a mobile-first SaaS platform designed for restaurant feedback collection and analysis. The platform enables restaurant groups to collect customer feedback through multiple channels, analyze the data for insights, and take action to improve customer experience.

The system follows a client-server architecture with a React frontend and Supabase backend, implementing a multi-tenant data isolation model to serve multiple restaurant organizations securely.

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Shared database with row-level security for data isolation
2. **Backend Platform**: Supabase for database, authentication, and real-time features
3. **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript for type-safe development
4. **UI Components**: Shadcn UI built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
5. **State Management**: Hybrid approach using Zustand and React Query
6. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom wrapper
7. **Database Schema**: Hybrid normalized/denormalized design with materialized views
8. **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
9. **PWA Implementation**: Full PWA features for offline access and app-like experience
10. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Core**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand, React Query
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for native features
- **PWA**: Vite PWA Plugin, Workbox

### Backend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime
- **Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Supabase Static Hosting
- **CDN**: Global content delivery network
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking
- **Payments**: Stripe integration

## Data Model

The platform implements a comprehensive data model to support restaurant feedback management:

### Core Entities
- **Tenants**: Restaurant organizations using the platform
- **Users**: Staff members with role-based access control
- **Locations**: Physical restaurant locations
- **Feedback**: Customer feedback submissions
- **Campaigns**: Marketing and engagement campaigns
- **Events**: Gamification and engagement events

### Enhanced Entities
- **Notifications**: User notification system
- **Feedback Questions**: Normalized feedback question structure
- **Feedback Responses**: Detailed feedback responses
- **Segments**: Customer segmentation for targeting

### Security Model
- **Row Level Security**: PostgreSQL RLS for tenant data isolation
- **Role-Based Access**: Hierarchical role system (Owner, Admin, Manager, Staff, Viewer)
- **Permission System**: Fine-grained permissions for specific actions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of user actions

## System Patterns

### Multi-tenancy Pattern
```
Tenant A ──┐
           ├── Users
Tenant B ──┤── Locations
           ├── Feedback
Tenant C ──┘── Campaigns
```

### Data Flow Pattern
```
Customer → Feedback Form → Supabase → 
Real-time Updates → Dashboard → 
Analytics Processing → Reports
```

### Authentication Flow
```
User → Login → Supabase Auth → 
JWT Token → Protected Routes → 
RLS Policies → Database Access
```
