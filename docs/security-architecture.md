# Security Architecture

The InteliFeed Hub platform implements a comprehensive security architecture to protect user data, ensure privacy, and maintain system integrity. This document outlines the security measures, policies, and best practices implemented throughout the platform.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
The platform implements multiple layers of security controls to protect against various threat vectors:
- Network security
- Application security
- Data security
- Identity and access management
- Monitoring and logging

### Least Privilege
All system components operate with the minimum permissions necessary to perform their functions.

### Secure by Default
Security controls are enabled by default, and insecure configurations require explicit approval.

### Privacy by Design
Data protection and privacy considerations are integrated into all system components from the beginning.

## Authentication

### User Authentication
The platform uses Supabase Auth for secure user authentication with the following features:

1. **Email/Password Authentication**
   - Secure password hashing using bcrypt
   - Password strength requirements
   - Account lockout after failed attempts

2. **Social Authentication**
   - Google, Facebook, and other OAuth providers
   - Secure token exchange
   - Account linking capabilities

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)
   - SMS-based verification
   - Recovery codes

### Session Management
- JWT tokens with secure signing
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Secure cookie handling
- Session invalidation on logout

### Password Security
- Minimum 12-character passwords
- Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Password history to prevent reuse
- Secure password reset workflows

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The platform implements a hierarchical role system:

1. **Owner**: Full access to all tenant resources
2. **Admin**: Manage users, locations, and settings
3. **Manager**: Manage feedback and campaigns
4. **Staff**: View and respond to feedback
5. **Viewer**: Read-only access to reports

### Permission System
Fine-grained permissions control access to specific resources:
- `manage_users`: Create, update, and delete users
- `manage_locations`: Create and update locations
- `view_analytics`: Access analytics dashboards
- `manage_campaigns`: Create and send campaigns
- `manage_billing`: Access billing information

### Row Level Security (RLS)
PostgreSQL Row Level Security ensures data isolation between tenants:
```sql
-- Users can only view feedbacks for locations in their tenant
CREATE POLICY "Users can view feedbacks in their tenant" ON feedbacks
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM locations l 
      WHERE l.id = feedbacks.location_id 
      AND l.tenant_id = get_current_tenant_id()
    )
  );
```

## Data Protection

### Encryption
1. **Data at Rest**
   - PostgreSQL database encryption
   - Supabase storage encryption
   - Application-level encryption for sensitive fields

2. **Data in Transit**
   - TLS 1.3 encryption for all communications
   - Strict transport security headers
   - Certificate pinning for critical services

3. **End-to-End Encryption**
   - Client-side encryption for highly sensitive data
   - Secure key management using Supabase Vault
