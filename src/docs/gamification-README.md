const CustomerProfile = ({ customerId }) => {
  const { profile, loading, error } = useCustomerGamification({ customerId });
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  if (!profile) return <div>No profile found</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{profile.customerName}</h2>
      <p>Points: {profile.totalPoints}</p>
      <p>Level: {profile.level}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Redeeming a Reward
```typescript
import { useCustomerGamification } from "@/hooks/useCustomerGamification";

const RewardRedemption = ({ customerId }) => {
  const { rewards, redeemReward } = useCustomerGamification({ customerId });
  
  const handleRedeem = async (rewardId) => {
    const success = await redeemReward(rewardId);
    if (success) {
      alert("Reward redeemed successfully!");
    } else {
      alert("Failed to redeem reward");
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      {rewards.map(reward => (
        <div key={reward.id}>
          <h3>{reward.name}</h3>
          <p>{reward.description}</p>
          <p>Cost: {reward.cost} points</p>
          <button onClick={() => handleRedeem(reward.id)}>
            Redeem

        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Customer gamification service tests
- React hook tests
- Component tests

### Integration Tests
- Database function tests
- API endpoint tests
- End-to-end user flow tests

## Deployment

### Database Migration
Run the migration script to create the necessary tables and functions:
```bash
supabase migration up
```

### Frontend Deployment
The frontend components are automatically included in the main application build.

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Customer engagement rate
- Point redemption rate
- Event participation rate
- Leaderboard activity

### Dashboards
- Admin dashboard for gamification metrics
- Customer analytics dashboard
- Real-time event monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Points not updating** - Check database function permissions
2. **Rewards not redeeming** - Verify customer has sufficient points
3. **Leaderboard not updating** - Ensure materialized views are refreshed

### Debugging Tips
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Check Supabase logs for database errors
